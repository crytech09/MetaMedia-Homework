What the Internet Is <James Min>

Nowadays, the internet is being used for many different usages. 
As technology develops, the internet can do more and more things. 
However, I personally think that the ultimate goal for the use of the internet is to make our life comfortable. 
To increase the quality of life. The basic thing we think of when we think about the internet a network. 
By simply using this network, people all around the world can be connected. 
Internet did make our life much more comfortable and easier. On the other hand, the internet also brought some negative effects, such as hacking or a virus.
Most of the people save important files or data by using the internet. Some of them even send important data by using the internet. Furthermore, we now use called internet banking, which is saving and using our money by using the internet. 
In this case, if someone tries to hack and steal this important data or money from every people and if it works, it will be great chaos. 
This internet was first invented as a purpose of “Network of Network”. To connect every computer into one network system. However, it did work connecting computers with clients and servers, the Internet got a nickname, which was an ocean of the information. 
In the past, the internet was also used for military reason. Throughout these improvements and efforts, nowadays, almost all population around the world is using the internet, and it has some negative effects and some risks, but it is still a fact that the internet brought our life quality higher than before.
